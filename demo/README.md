# Demo Videos & GIFs

This folder contains demo videos and GIFs for the Checkit project.

## Recommended Formats

### For Quick Previews (Best Option)
- **GIF**: Animated GIF files (`.gif`)
  - GitHub displays GIFs directly in README
  - Best for short demos (under 10 seconds)
  - Keep file size under 5MB for best performance
  - Tools: [GIPHY Capture](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture), [Kap](https://getkap.co/), or [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/)

### For Full Videos
- **MP4**: MP4 video files (`.mp4`)
  - GitHub will show a download link
  - Users can download and watch
  - Better quality than GIFs
  - Keep under 25MB for GitHub

### For External Hosting
- Upload to YouTube, Vimeo, or Cloudinary
- Embed using the links in the main README

## How to Add Your Demo
